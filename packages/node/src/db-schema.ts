/**
 * clientAppInstanceID explanation:
 *
 * When a Node client initiates an AppInstance installation proposal, a UUID is
 * generated in the Node to identify this proposed app instance. To the Node
 * clients, this UUID becomes the ID of the AppInstance they proposed to install,
 * hence clientAppInstanceID.
 * This enables the client to immediately get a response from the Node with
 * an ID to use as a handle for the proposed AppInstance.
 *
 * When a peer Node receiving this proposal accepts it and installs it, this
 * installation generates the channelAppInstanceID for the app instance as the
 * act of installation updates the state of the channel. The two IDs,
 * clientAppInstanceID and channelAppInstanceID are then globally mapped
 * (i.e. by all participating Nodes) to each other. Any time any clients use the
 * clientAppInstanceID to refer to the AppInstance, the Node does a look up
 * for the channelAppInstanceID to get/set any state for that AppInstance inside
 * the relevant channel.
 *
