Node Protocol
=============

Public Methods
--------------

Returns **all** app instances currently installed on the Node. 

**NOTE**: This is terrible from a security perspective. In the future this method will be changed or deprecated to fix the security flaw. 

Params: `[]`

Result: list of [AppInstance](#appinstance)

#### proposeInstall

Generate an app instance ID given details about an app installation.  

Params:
- `peerAddress: string` 
    - Address of the peer to install the app with
- `appId: string` 
    - On-chain address of App Definition contract

- `asset: `[`BlockchainAsset`](#blockchainasset)
    - The asset used for deposits into this app
- `myDeposit: BigNumber`
    - Amount of the asset deposited by this user
- `peerDeposit: BigNumber`
    - Amount of the asset deposited by the counterparty
- `timeout: BigNumber`
    - Number of blocks until a submitted state for this app is considered finalized
- `initialState: `[`AppState`](#appstate)
    - Initial state of app instance
    
Result: 
- `appInstanceId: string`
    - Unique ID for this app instance 

Errors: (TODO)
- Not enough funds

#### rejectInstall

Reject an app instance installation. 

Params:
- `appInstanceId: string`
    - Unique ID for the app instance to reject 
    
Result: "OK"

Errors: (TODO)
- Proposed app instance doesn't exist

#### install

Install an app instance. 

Params:
- `appInstanceId: string`
    - Unique ID for the app instance to install 
    

Result:
- `appInstance: `[`AppInstance`](#appinstance)
    - Successfully installed app instance

Errors: (TODO)
- Counterparty rejected installation

#### getState

Get the latest state of an app instance.

Params:
- `appInstanceId: string`
    - Unique ID of the app instance 

Result:
- `state: `[`AppState`](#appstate)

Errors: (TODO)
- App not installed


#### getAppInstanceDetails

Get details of an app instance.

Params:
- `appInstanceId: string`
    - Unique ID of the app instance 

Result:
- `appInstance: `[`AppInstance`](#appinstance)
    - App instance details


#### takeAction

Take action on current app state to advance it to a new state.

Params:
- `appInstanceId: string`
    - Unique ID of the app instance 
    - Action to take on the current state 

Result:
- `newState: `[`AppState`](#appstate)
    - New app state

Errors: (TODO)
- Illegal action

#### uninstall

Uninstall an app instance, paying out users according to the latest signed state.

Params:
- `appInstanceId: string`
    - Unique ID of the app instance to uninstall

Result:
- `myPayout: BigNumber`
    - Amount of the asset paid out to this user 
- `peerPayout: BigNumber`
    - Amount of the asset paid out to peer
    
Errors: (TODO)
- App state not terminal
