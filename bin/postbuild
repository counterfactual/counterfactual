# node module resolution is not supported yet by tsc so we can't reference tsconfig files
# directly in the @counterfactual/configs repo
# https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/18865
# a workaround is to redirect the relative path to the hoisted node_modules directory
# at the top of repo, but leave the original relative path in place as each package
# can resolve this configs package via their local node_modules folder when their
# build runs separately
